# Data Analytics Portfolio
Hello! Welcome to my repository - these are my personal projects :)

## Completed
### [U.S. Population Trends](https://github.com/chloelinli/chloelinli.github.io/tree/main/projects/us_population_trends)
Advanced medicine and technology have contributed to an increased birth rate, correlating to an increased population. Due to overpopulation concerns, it seems that natural increase is a more significant factor in population increase compared to immigration. To complete this project, I compared U.S. public birth rate data with 2010-2020 census results, as well as researched reliable quotes and sources.

Skills: Microsoft Excel/Google Sheets

## In Progress
### [My Personal Spotify Listening Habits](https://github.com/chloelinli/chloelinli.github.io/tree/main/projects/spotify_listening)
I wanted to see how the type of music I used to and currently listen to may affect my future music taste. Using my Spotify streaming history from the past year, I cleaned and queried the data so that I could have the top 50 most listened to songs to analyze and compare to the music phases I had gone through.

### [Facial Recognition within Art](https://github.com/chloelinli/chloelinli.github.io/tree/main/projects/art_facial_recognition)
A past assignment I had worked on asked to see how closely we could reconstruct and recognize something in an image. The language used was MATLAB, but I wanted to use Python for this project so I had to convert the code I had written before. To further expand on the project, I wanted to test different methods for reconstruction and recognition to see which one gives the highest accuracy. As for recognition, I have set up three difficulties in order to compare images, where the test set include various images that are distingishable from the training set based on difficulty. To further expand on this project, I plan to calculate runtime as well as look into varying methods of reconstruction and recognition to analyze the most accurate and efficient methods.
