# Data Analytics Portfolio
Hello! Welcome to my repository - these are my personal projects :)

## Completed
### [U.S. Population Trends](https://github.com/chloelinli/chloelinli.github.io/tree/main/projects/us_population_trends)
Advanced medicine and technology have contributed to an increased birth rate, correlating to an increased population. Due to overpopulation concerns, it seems that natural increase is a more significant factor in population increase compared to immigration. To complete this project, I compared U.S. public birth rate data with 2010-2020 census results, as well as researched reliable quotes and sources.

**Skills**: Microsoft Excel/Google Sheets

### [Tokyo Airbnb Analysis Dashboards](https://github.com/chloelinli/chloelinli.github.io/tree/main/projects/tokyo_airbnb_analysis)
These interactive dashboards were created as a way to practice using Tableau and R, as well as provide a simple resource to give some friends and myself a jump-start when searching for housing our future trip to Japan. The Tableau dashboard utilizes filters and a pannable map to view location, while the R dashboard utilizes an interactive Shiny app dashboard.

**Skills**: Tableau, R

## In Progress
### [My Personal Spotify Listening Habits](https://github.com/chloelinli/chloelinli.github.io/tree/main/projects/spotify_listening)
I wanted to see how the type of music I used to and currently listen to may affect my future music taste. Using my Spotify streaming history from the past year, I cleaned and queried the data so that I could have the top 50 most listened to songs to analyze and compare to the music phases I had gone through.

- [ ] Learning algorithm for future songs

**Skills**: SQL, Tableau, Microsoft Excel/Google Sheets, Python

### [Facial Recognition within Art](https://github.com/chloelinli/chloelinli.github.io/tree/main/projects/art_facial_recognition)
I took a past assignment that asked to see how accurately we can reconstruct and recognize images, and converted the language used from MATLAB to Python. I also expanded on recognition by including three difficulties for testing image comparison. To further expand on the project, I plan to calculate runtime as well as look into varying methods of reconstruction and recognition to find which are the most efficient and accurate.

**Skills**: Python, Microsoft Excel/Google Sheets

### [Tokyo Airbnb Analysis](https://github.com/chloelinli/chloelinli.github.io/tree/main/projects/tokyo_airbnb_analysis)
In order to practice using Tableau and R, I decided to turn a personal interest into a project. This will then be used to assist in researching for my future trip to Japan. I received constructive criticism from friends who I plan to travel with to help improve the dashboard and make it easier to navigate. Future plans include utilizing the language R to create a dashboard containing information that was otherwise unnecessary in the Tableau dashboard.
