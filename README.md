# Data Analytics Portfolio
Hello! Welcome to my repository - these are my personal projects :)

Check out my website [here](https://chloerushing.wixsite.com/da-portfolio)!

## Completed
### [U.S. Population Trends](https://github.com/chloelinli/chloelinli.github.io/tree/main/projects/us_population_trends)
Due to the concern of overpopulation in the United States, I asked myself, "Thanks to advanced medicine and technology, our birth rate continues to increase, correlating to a population increase. Does this mean that between the two factors, immigration and natural increase, that birth rates are the primary contributor to the U.S. population?" I then analyzed public birth rate data from the U.S CDC website and compared the results with Census data from 2010 and 2020 as well as other relevant information.

## In Progress
### [My Personal Spotify Listening Habits](https://github.com/chloelinli/chloelinli.github.io/tree/main/projects/spotify_listening)
I wanted to see how the type of music I used to and currently listen to may affect my future music taste. Using my Spotify streaming history from the past year, I cleaned and queried the data so that I could have the top 50 most listened to songs to analyze and compare to the music phases I had gone through.

### [Facial Recognition within Art](https://github.com/chloelinli/chloelinli.github.io/tree/main/projects/art_facial_recognition)
A past assignment I had asked to see how closely we could reconstruct and recognize something in an image. The language used was MATLAB, but I wanted to use Python for this project so I had to convert the code I had written before. To further expand on the project, I wanted to test different methods for reconstruction and recognition to see which one gives the highest accuracy. As for recognition, I have set up three difficulties in order to compare images, where the test set include various images that are distingishable from the training set based on difficulty. Currently I have not decided how I will test different recognition methods.
