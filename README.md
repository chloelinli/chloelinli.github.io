### [U.S. Birth Rate Trends](https://github.com/chloelinli/chloelinli.github.io/tree/main/projects/us_birth_rate_trends_20221006)
Due to the concern of overpopulation in the United States, I asked myself, "Thanks to advanced medicine and technology, our birth rate continues to increase, correlating to a population increase. Does this that between the two factors, immigration and natural increase, that birth rates are the primary contributor to the U.S. population?" I then analyzed public birth trend data from the U.S CDC website and compared the results with Census data from 2010 and 2020 as well as other relevant information.
