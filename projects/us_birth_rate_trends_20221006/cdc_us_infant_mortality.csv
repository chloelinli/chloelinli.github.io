"\1Infant (under age 1 year), neonatal (under 28 days) and early neonatal (under 7 days), and postneonatal (28 days–11 months). See Sources and Definitions, Infant death.
\2Includes births and deaths of people who were not residents of the 50 states or the District of Columbia. In 1950, deaths of people in Alaska and Hawaii were not included because these states did not attain statehood until 1959.
\3Infant deaths and live births are tabulated by race of infant. See Sources and Definitions, Race.
\4Infant deaths are tabulated by race of infant; live births are tabulated by race of mother. See Sources and Definitions, Race.
\5The race groups White and Black or African American include people of Hispanic and non-Hispanic origin. People of Hispanic origin may be of any race. Starting with 2018 data, race on death records is available based on the 1997 “Revisions to the Standards for the Classification of Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity” and presented as single-race estimates (only one race was reported on the birth certificate). Data for 2003–2017 were tabulated according to the 1977 standards, and race data were bridged to retain comparability across states as they transitioned from 1977 to 1997 standards. Single-race estimates for 2018 and beyond are not completely comparable with bridged-race estimates for earlier years, particularly for the smaller race categories. To look at longer-term trends, bridged-race estimates are also presented. See Sources and Definitions, Hispanic origin; Race.",,,,
"NOTES: Infant mortality rates are based on infant deaths from the mortality file (numerator) and live births from the natality file (denominator). Inconsistencies in reporting race for the same infant between the birth and death certificates can result in underestimated infant mortality rates for races other than White or Black. Infant mortality rates for additional population groups are available from the Linked Birth/Infant Death Data Set. See Sources and Definitions, Rate: Death and related rates. Data for additional years are available in the Excel spreadsheet version of this table on the Health, United States website at: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/hus/index.htm.",,,,
