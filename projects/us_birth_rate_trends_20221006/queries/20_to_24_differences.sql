/*
These queries use BigQuery to calculate the difference in values within the
birth rates for each race within the 20-24 age group. These values were
then manually written into a Google Spreadsheet and formatted as percentages.
"All" refers to the section labeled "All races" as provided by the CDC dataset.
Unsure what "Single Race" is meant to refer to, but will continue to calculate
the data separately and include it in the spreadsheets.
