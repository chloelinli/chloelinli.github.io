\1Live births per 1,000 population. See Sources and Definitions, Rate: Birth and related rates.
\2Total number of live births regardless of age of mother per 1,000 women aged 15–44.
\3Before 1997, data included live births to mothers aged 45–49 per 1,000 women aged 45–49. For 1997 and beyond, rates are computed by dividing the number of births to women aged 45 and over by the population of women aged 45–49. See Sources and Definitions, Age.
\4Live births are tabulated by race of child. See Sources and Definitions, Race.
\5The race groups white, black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander include people of Hispanic and non-Hispanic origin. People of Hispanic origin may be of any race. Starting with 2016 data, race on birth records is available based on the 1997 “Revisions to the Standards for the Classification of Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity” and presented as single-race estimates (only one race was reported on the birth certificate). These estimates include separate estimates for non-Hispanic Asian and non-Hispanic Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander groups. Data for 2003–2015 were tabulated according to the 1977 standards, and race data were bridged to retain comparability across states as they transitioned from 1977 to 1997 standards. Single-race estimates for 2016 and beyond are not completely comparable with bridged-race estimates for earlier years, particularly for the smaller race categories. To look at longer-term trends, bridged-race estimates are also presented. The combined group of non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander women is also shown. See Sources and Definitions, Hispanic origin; Race.
\6Live births are tabulated by race and Hispanic origin of mother. See Sources and Definitions, Race.
\7Before 1993, data from states that did not report Hispanic origin on the birth certificate were excluded. See Sources and Definitions, Hispanic origin. Rates in 1985 were not calculated because estimates for the Hispanic and non-Hispanic populations were not available. Interpretation of trend data for Hispanic women should take into consideration the expansion of reporting areas.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"NOTES: Data are based on births adjusted for underregistration for 1950 and on registered births for all other years. Starting with 1970 data, births to people who were not residents of the 50 states or the District of Columbia are excluded. Birth data for Alaska and Hawaii have been included since 1959 and 1960, respectively. Starting with Health, United States, 2003, rates for 1991–1999 were revised using intercensal population estimates based on the 1990 and 2000 censuses. Rates for 2000 were based on bridged-race April 1, 2000, census counts. Starting with Health, United States, 2012, rates for 2001–2009 were revised using intercensal population estimates based on the 2000 and 2010 censuses. Rates for 2010 were based on bridged-race April 1, 2010 census counts. Rates for 2011 and beyond are computed using 2010-based postcensal estimates. See Sources and Definitions, Population Census and Population Estimates. Data for additional years are available in the Excel spreadsheet version of this table on the Health, United States website at: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/hus/index.htm.",,,,,,,,,,,,
