Caveats:,,,,,,
1. Each birth record represents one liveborn infant.,,,,,,
2. Birth rates are calculated as the number of births divided by total population in the given year(s). When the numerator is,,,,,,
"sub-set by mother's race, mother's hispanicity, location, or year of birth, then the same sub-set for age, race, hispanicity,",,,,,,
location and year applies to the denominator population.,,,,,,
3. Caution should be used when interpreting the Average Age of Mother measure. All ages 12 years and less are coded to 12 years.,,,,,,
All ages 50 years and over are coded to 50 years. The number of counts in those two age goups are small and should not have a,,,,,,
great effect on the average age. Consider doing queries with and without these two age groups and compare the effect on Average,,,,,,
Age of Mother measure.,,,,,,
4. Please note that the Percent of Total presented here may not be consistent with percentages published by NCHS. NCHS excludes,,,,,,
"births categorized as ""Unknown"", ""Not Stated"", ""Not on Certificate"", ""Excluded"", and ""Not Reported"" from the",,,,,,
denominator when calculating percentages.,,,,,,
5. Birth rates and fertility rates are calculated using the following populations: The populations for year 2019 are from the,,,,,,
