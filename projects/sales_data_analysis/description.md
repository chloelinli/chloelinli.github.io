# Data and Approach
### Data
E-commerce Business Transaction, [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gabrielramos87/an-online-shop-business](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gabrielramos87/an-online-shop-business)

### Approach
Before starting, I realized the date attribute in the data was in the wrong format for me to make sure I created a SQL table properly. First, the date was in text format meaning when I tried to convert in the Excel workbook, there would be no changes. Thus, I used Excel's built-in Text to Columns function under the Data tab which allowed me to reformat the date from MDY to YYY-MM-DD. Once this was done, I saved the workbook as a CSV to use for this project.
