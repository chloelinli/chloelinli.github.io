### Data and Approach
#### Data
E-commerce Business Transaction, [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gabrielramos87/an-online-shop-business](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gabrielramos87/an-online-shop-business)

#### Approach
First, the data attribute in the data was in in an inconsistent date format of M/D/Y rather than somesthing like MM/DD/YYYY. I used Excel's built-in Text to Columns function under the Data tab which allowed me to reformat the date from MDY to YYY-MM-DD. Once this was done, I saved the workbook as a CSV to use for this project.
